# Rust testing frameworks

... tried out.

Folders herein:

- untested_code: A piece of untested code that should serve as template for
further tests
- mockall_mock_a_sensor: Multiple approaches with cargo test and mockall
(not in sync with the template



## Used already:

* Cargo test (buillt-in)
* https://crates.io/crates/mockall : A powerful mock object library for Rust.
