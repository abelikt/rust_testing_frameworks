// "As you have already learned, you cannot replace methods on a type.
// The only thing you can do is move the methods to a trait and then
// provide production and test-specific implementations of that trait.
// How you structure the trait determines the granularity of what you
// are able to test.

/*
* Within my team it has been debated whether the best style is to
* exclusively depend on abstract interfaces, everywhere. My personal
* view is that this should be determined by the runtime intent. In high
* level languages this is usually no problem, because method dispatch is
* usually dynamic dy default. This means that any or most concrete types
* or classes are easily sub-classable, and thus the coupling to such a
* class by name is not really that strong under the hood. All
* python/Java/Kotlin/JS languages support this easily: Creating mocks of
* concrete types.
* ...
* So the way to express an abstraction in Rust is to use a trait.
* Trait mocking in Rust today is fairly developer friendly, but not as
* friendly as in dynamic-dispatch-languages. What Iâ€™ve been doing so
* far is to introduce a new trait everywhere I need test isolation,
* and use the crate mockall to autogenerate a mocked implementation
* that I instantiate in my test. Not very far from how java/mockito or
* jest works, except that, as mentioned, we always need to be very
* explicit about the abstraction taking place:
